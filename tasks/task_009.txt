# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Offline Functionality and Sync Indicators
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Add offline capabilities and visual indicators for synchronization status throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Implement local caching for critical data
2. Add offline detection and handling
3. Create visual indicators for online/offline status
4. Implement sync status indicators (synced, pending, error)
5. Add conflict resolution for offline edits
6. Implement background sync when connection is restored
7. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
8. Create user notifications for sync events

# Test Strategy:
Test application behavior when network is disconnected. Verify data can be viewed and modified offline. Test synchronization when connection is restored. Verify visual indicators accurately reflect sync status.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Network Status Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a service to detect and monitor network connectivity status
### Details:
Develop a NetworkService that uses browser's navigator.onLine and addEventListener for 'online'/'offline' events. Implement a reactive state (using BehaviorSubject or similar) that components can subscribe to. Include methods like isOnline(), getConnectionStatus(), and an observable stream for real-time status updates.

## 2. Implement Local Storage Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust local storage system for caching application data
### Details:
Implement a StorageService that abstracts IndexedDB operations (consider using Dexie.js or similar library). Create data models and schemas for offline storage. Implement CRUD operations that handle both local storage and API interactions. Include versioning metadata for each stored entity to track sync status.

## 3. Add UI Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement visual indicators for network and sync status
### Details:
Create a status component for the app header showing online/offline state. Design and implement sync status icons (synced ✓, pending ⟳, error ⚠) for list items. Add appropriate color coding (green for synced, amber for pending, red for errors). Ensure indicators are accessible with proper aria attributes and tooltips explaining status.

## 4. Implement Offline Data Access [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Modify data services to serve cached data when offline
### Details:
Update all data services to check network status before API calls. When offline, serve data from local storage. Implement request queuing for write operations when offline. Add timestamp tracking for cached data to identify stale information. Ensure UI properly reflects that data being displayed is from cache.

## 5. Implement Background Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Create system to sync cached changes when connection is restored
### Details:
Develop a SyncService that activates when online status changes to true. Implement a queue processing system that handles pending operations in the correct order. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed operations. Include hooks for sync lifecycle events (started, completed, failed). Consider using the Background Sync API where supported.

## 6. Implement Conflict Resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Add logic to handle conflicts between local and server data
### Details:
Implement timestamp-based conflict detection comparing local and server modification times. Create conflict resolution strategies: server-wins (default), client-wins, and manual resolution where appropriate. For manual resolution, design a UI that shows differences and lets users choose which version to keep. Store conflict resolution preferences for repeat scenarios.

## 7. Add User Notifications for Sync Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.5, 9.6
### Description: Implement a notification system for synchronization events
### Details:
Create a NotificationService to display toast/snackbar messages for key sync events. Show notifications for: sync completed, sync failed, conflicts detected, and manual resolution required. Add a sync history view where users can see past sync activities and errors. Include actionable links in notifications (retry, resolve, view details) where appropriate.
