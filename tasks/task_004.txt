# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Authentication Module (auth.js)
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an authentication module using Firebase Authentication for administrators and access code verification for coordinators.
# Details:
1. Create auth.js module with Firebase Authentication integration
2. Implement admin login with email/password
3. Implement coordinator login with access code verification
4. Add session management and persistence
5. Create user state observers
6. Implement logout functionality
7. Add security rules to protect routes based on user role
8. Handle authentication errors with user-friendly messages

# Test Strategy:
Test login flows for both admin and coordinator roles. Verify session persistence across page reloads. Test access restrictions based on user roles. Verify error handling with invalid credentials.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Firebase Authentication and create auth.js module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Firebase Authentication in the project and create the basic structure of the auth.js module
### Details:
Create auth.js file with Firebase initialization. Import necessary Firebase Authentication modules. Set up the basic structure with exported functions for login, logout, and state management. Configure Firebase project settings and add SDK to the application.

## 2. Implement admin authentication with email/password [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create functions for admin login, registration, and password reset using Firebase Authentication
### Details:
Implement signInWithEmailAndPassword for admin login. Add createUserWithEmailAndPassword for admin registration if needed. Create sendPasswordResetEmail functionality. Add appropriate error handling with specific error codes and user-friendly messages for admin authentication flows.

## 3. Implement coordinator authentication with access codes [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a custom authentication flow for coordinators using access codes
### Details:
Implement a function to verify access codes against a database of valid codes. Use Firebase custom authentication or anonymous auth with custom claims for coordinators. Store coordinator information with appropriate role designation. Include error handling for invalid access codes with user-friendly messages.

## 4. Add session management and user state observers [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Implement persistence for user sessions and create observers for authentication state changes
### Details:
Configure Firebase persistence settings (local, session, or none). Implement onAuthStateChanged listener to track authentication state. Create a user context or state management store to maintain current user information. Add functions to check if a user is authenticated and determine their role (admin or coordinator).

## 5. Implement logout functionality and session cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Create secure logout functions and handle session termination properly
### Details:
Implement signOut functionality from Firebase. Clear any local storage or cookies related to the session. Reset application state on logout. Add confirmation for logout if appropriate. Handle any errors that might occur during the logout process.

## 6. Add route protection and security rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Implement route guards to protect routes based on authentication status and user roles
### Details:
Create higher-order components or route guards to check authentication status before rendering protected components. Implement role-based access control to differentiate between admin and coordinator permissions. Add redirect logic for unauthenticated users or unauthorized access attempts. Configure Firebase security rules to protect backend resources based on authentication and roles.
