# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Admin Menu Publication Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the interface for administrators to publish the weekly menu.
# Details:
In admin.html, create a form that allows the admin to select a week start date and enter dishes for each day of the week. The form should include date inputs and text fields for dishes. Implement JavaScript functionality to save the menu to IndexedDB. Display previously created menus with options to edit or delete them. Ensure the interface is clean and minimal as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test creating, editing, and deleting menus. Verify that the data is correctly stored in IndexedDB. Test edge cases like empty fields and invalid dates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic menu publication form structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the HTML structure for the menu publication form in admin.html
### Details:
Create a form in admin.html with the following elements: 1) A date input for selecting the week start date, 2) Seven sections (one for each day of the week) with appropriate labels, 3) Text input fields for entering multiple dishes for each day, 4) Add/remove buttons for dish fields, 5) Submit button to save the menu. Use semantic HTML and ensure the layout follows the clean, minimal design specified in the PRD. Include a container section where saved menus will be displayed.

## 2. Implement date handling and dynamic form generation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add JavaScript functionality to handle date selection and dynamically generate day labels
### Details:
Write JavaScript code that: 1) Listens for changes to the week start date input, 2) Automatically calculates and displays the correct date for each day of the week (e.g., 'Monday, Jan 1'), 3) Implements the add/remove functionality for dish input fields, allowing admins to add multiple dishes per day, 4) Validates that the selected date is a Monday to ensure weeks always start on the same day. Use event listeners and DOM manipulation to update the form dynamically.

## 3. Create IndexedDB storage functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement the JavaScript functions to save menu data to IndexedDB
### Details:
Create JavaScript functions to: 1) Initialize the IndexedDB database with an object store for menus if it doesn't exist, 2) Collect form data when the submit button is clicked, 3) Validate the form data to ensure all required fields are filled, 4) Create a structured menu object with the week start date as the key and daily dishes as values, 5) Save the menu object to IndexedDB, 6) Show a success message after saving. Handle any potential errors during database operations with appropriate error messages.

## 4. Implement menu listing and retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create functionality to display previously saved menus
### Details:
Develop JavaScript code to: 1) Retrieve all saved menus from IndexedDB when the admin page loads, 2) Display the menus in the designated container in chronological order, with the most recent week first, 3) For each menu, show the week start date and a collapsed view of the menu that can be expanded, 4) Include edit and delete buttons for each menu, 5) Implement pagination or scrolling if there are many menus. Use appropriate UI components to maintain the clean interface while providing all necessary information.

## 5. Implement edit and delete functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Add the ability to modify or remove existing menus
### Details:
Create JavaScript functions that: 1) When the edit button is clicked, populate the form with the selected menu's data for editing, 2) Update the existing menu in IndexedDB when changes are submitted, 3) Implement delete functionality with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions, 4) Remove the menu from IndexedDB when confirmed, 5) Update the menu listing immediately after edits or deletions without requiring a page refresh. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout these operations.
