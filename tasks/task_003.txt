# Task ID: 3
# Title: Adapt Storage Module (storage.js)
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing storage module to use Firebase Firestore while maintaining the same API for backward compatibility.
# Details:
1. Analyze existing localStorage implementation
2. Refactor storage.js to use Firebase module for data operations
3. Maintain the same function signatures and return values
4. Implement local caching for offline functionality
5. Add data migration utility to transfer existing localStorage data to Firebase
6. Implement conflict resolution for synchronization
7. Add error handling and retry mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases comparing localStorage vs Firebase implementations. Verify data consistency between both storage methods. Test migration utility with sample data. Simulate network interruptions to verify offline functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze existing localStorage implementation and create Firebase adapter [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current storage.js module to understand its API and create a Firebase adapter that will handle the Firestore operations.
### Details:
1. Document all public methods and their signatures in the current storage.js
2. Map localStorage operations to equivalent Firestore operations
3. Create a FirebaseAdapter class that will handle all Firestore interactions
4. Initialize Firebase connection in the adapter
5. Implement basic CRUD operations in the adapter (create, read, update, delete)
6. Add proper error handling with meaningful error messages

## 2. Refactor storage.js to use Firebase adapter while maintaining API [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Modify the storage.js module to use the new Firebase adapter while keeping the same function signatures and return values for backward compatibility.
### Details:
1. Import and initialize the Firebase adapter
2. Refactor each existing method to use the Firebase adapter instead of localStorage
3. Ensure all methods maintain the same signatures (parameters and return types)
4. Add appropriate error handling and conversion between Firebase and existing data formats
5. Write unit tests to verify API compatibility
6. Document any edge cases or behavior differences

## 3. Implement local caching for offline functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Add a caching layer to ensure the storage module works offline by caching Firestore data locally.
### Details:
1. Implement a cache manager that stores Firestore data in localStorage
2. Add cache invalidation strategies (time-based, manual, etc.)
3. Modify read operations to first check cache before making Firestore requests
4. Implement write operations to update both Firestore and local cache
5. Add a mechanism to detect offline status and queue write operations
6. Implement cache synchronization when connection is restored

## 4. Create data migration utility [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop a utility to migrate existing localStorage data to Firebase Firestore.
### Details:
1. Create a function to read all existing data from localStorage
2. Add data transformation logic to convert localStorage format to Firestore format
3. Implement batch writing to efficiently upload data to Firestore
4. Add progress tracking and reporting for migration process
5. Implement validation to ensure data integrity after migration
6. Add rollback capability in case of migration failure

## 5. Implement conflict resolution for synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Add mechanisms to detect and resolve conflicts when the same data is modified in multiple places.
### Details:
1. Implement timestamp-based versioning for all data objects
2. Add conflict detection by comparing local and remote timestamps
3. Create merge strategies for different data types (last-write-wins, custom merging, etc.)
4. Implement user notification system for manual conflict resolution when needed
5. Add transaction support for atomic operations
6. Create logging for conflict events for debugging purposes

## 6. Add error handling, retry mechanisms and finalize integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Enhance error handling throughout the storage module and implement retry mechanisms for failed operations.
### Details:
1. Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed network requests
2. Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent excessive retries
3. Create comprehensive error classification system
4. Implement global error handler with appropriate logging
5. Add integration tests covering offline scenarios, conflict resolution, and error handling
6. Create documentation for the new storage module including migration guide for existing code
