# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Data Models and IndexedDB Storage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the data models for Menu, Coordinator, and Confirmation objects and implement IndexedDB storage functionality.
# Details:
Create a storage.js file that handles IndexedDB operations. Implement functions to create/open the database with three object stores: 'menus', 'coordinators', and 'confirmations'. Define the data models exactly as specified in the PRD. Implement CRUD operations for each model. Include a fallback to localStorage if IndexedDB is not available. Add export/import functionality for data backup.

# Test Strategy:
Write test cases to verify data can be saved to and retrieved from IndexedDB. Test the fallback mechanism by disabling IndexedDB in the browser. Verify data structure matches the specified models.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Data Models for Menu, Coordinator, and Confirmation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create JavaScript classes or object structures that define the data models according to the PRD specifications
### Details:
Create a models.js file that exports three data model classes/objects: Menu, Coordinator, and Confirmation. Each model should include all required properties and validation methods as specified in the PRD. For Menu, include properties like id, name, items, categories, etc. For Coordinator, include properties like id, name, contact information, etc. For Confirmation, include properties like id, menuId, coordinatorId, date, status, etc. Add appropriate constructor methods and validation functions to ensure data integrity.

## 2. Implement IndexedDB Database Creation and Schema Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the IndexedDB database with appropriate object stores and indexes
### Details:
In storage.js, implement a function to initialize the IndexedDB database. Create a function named 'initDatabase' that creates or opens a database named 'cateringApp' with version 1. Set up three object stores: 'menus', 'coordinators', and 'confirmations' with appropriate key paths (use 'id' as the keyPath). Add any necessary indexes for efficient querying (e.g., index on 'date' for confirmations). Handle database upgrade events properly. Export this function so it can be called during application initialization.

## 3. Implement CRUD Operations for Each Data Model [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create functions to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for each data model using IndexedDB
### Details:
In storage.js, implement and export the following functions for each data model (Menu, Coordinator, Confirmation): add[Model], get[Model], getAll[Models], update[Model], and delete[Model]. For example: addMenu, getMenu, getAllMenus, updateMenu, deleteMenu. Each function should return a Promise that resolves with the operation result. Ensure proper error handling with try/catch blocks and appropriate error messages. Include transaction management to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Create localStorage Fallback Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3
### Description: Implement a fallback storage system using localStorage when IndexedDB is not available
### Details:
Add a feature detection mechanism in storage.js to check if IndexedDB is supported by the browser. If not, implement alternative versions of all CRUD functions using localStorage. Create a wrapper for each storage function that attempts to use IndexedDB first, then falls back to localStorage if needed. For localStorage implementation, use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to convert objects to/from strings. Be mindful of localStorage size limitations and implement appropriate error handling.

## 5. Implement Data Export and Import Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create functions to export all data to a JSON file and import data from a JSON file
### Details:
Add exportData() and importData() functions to storage.js. The exportData function should retrieve all data from all object stores, combine it into a single JSON object, and either trigger a download or return the data as a string. The importData function should accept a JSON string or file, parse it, validate the structure against the data models, and then store the data in the appropriate object stores. Include version checking to handle potential schema changes. Add appropriate error handling and progress reporting for large datasets.
