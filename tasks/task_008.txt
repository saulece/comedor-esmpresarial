# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Data Export and Import Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to export and import data for backup purposes.
# Details:
Add buttons to the admin interface to export all data (menus, coordinators, confirmations) as a JSON file. Implement an import function that allows administrators to upload a previously exported JSON file to restore data. Include validation to ensure the imported data has the correct structure. This addresses the data persistence risk mentioned in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test exporting data and then importing it back. Verify that all data is correctly restored. Test importing invalid data and ensure appropriate error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement data export functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the backend functionality to export all application data (menus, coordinators, confirmations) as a JSON file
### Details:
Create a service that queries all necessary data models and serializes them into a structured JSON format. Implement an API endpoint that triggers this export process and returns the JSON file for download. Ensure proper error handling and include metadata like export timestamp in the JSON structure. The exported JSON should have a consistent schema that can be validated during import.

## 2. Add export button to admin interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Integrate the export functionality into the admin UI with a dedicated export button
### Details:
Add an 'Export Data' button to the admin interface. When clicked, it should call the export API endpoint and handle the file download process in the browser. Show appropriate loading states during export and success/error notifications. Consider adding a confirmation dialog before export to prevent accidental clicks.

## 3. Implement data import validation and processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create backend functionality to validate and process imported JSON data
### Details:
Develop a validation service that checks if the uploaded JSON file matches the expected schema structure. Implement validation for all required fields and data types. Create a processing service that can take validated JSON data and insert/update the corresponding database records. Include transaction support to ensure all-or-nothing imports that prevent partial data corruption. Add proper error handling with specific error messages for different validation failures.

## 4. Add import functionality to admin interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create a file upload component in the admin UI for importing previously exported JSON data
### Details:
Add an 'Import Data' button and file upload component to the admin interface. Implement client-side file type validation (JSON only). When a file is selected, show a confirmation dialog warning about potential data overwrite. On confirmation, upload the file to the import API endpoint. Display appropriate progress indicators during upload and import. Show success message on completion or detailed error messages if validation fails. Consider adding an option to preview the data before final import.
