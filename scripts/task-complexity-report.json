      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Adapt Storage Module (storage.js)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for adapting the storage module to use Firebase while maintaining backward compatibility, including analysis of existing code, refactoring strategies, caching implementation, data migration, and conflict resolution mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refactoring existing code while maintaining the same API, which is inherently complex. The implementation of local caching, data migration, and conflict resolution adds significant complexity. This is a critical module that other components will depend on."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Synchronization for Admin Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for implementing the real-time admin dashboard, including listener optimization, filtering mechanisms, summary statistics calculation, visual indicators, and data export functionality with specific implementation approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This is a complex task involving real-time data aggregation across multiple collections. It requires optimized Firestore listeners to avoid excessive reads, complex filtering, and summary statistics. The export functionality and proper listener cleanup add additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Offline Functionality and Sync Indicators",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for implementing offline functionality, including local caching strategies, connection state detection, conflict resolution algorithms, background synchronization, and user notification systems with specific technical approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks, dealing with offline capabilities and synchronization. Conflict resolution for offline edits is particularly challenging. The task requires sophisticated state management and careful handling of edge cases when transitioning between online and offline states."
