      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Minimal CSS Styling",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CSS styling task into specific subtasks covering base styles, form elements, responsive design, and testing across devices",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward CSS implementation task with clear requirements. The complexity is moderate as it involves responsive design considerations but explicitly avoids complex animations or effects. The scope is well-defined with focus on specific elements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up IndexedDB Storage",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the IndexedDB implementation into subtasks covering database initialization, CRUD operations, error handling, schema versioning, and testing",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves implementing a complete data persistence layer with IndexedDB. It requires database initialization, CRUD operations, error handling, and version control for the schema. These are technically challenging aspects that benefit from careful separation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Attendance Confirmation Form",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the form development into subtasks for UI creation, validation logic, IndexedDB integration, accessibility features, and user feedback mechanisms",
      "reasoning": "This task combines UI development with form validation, data storage integration, and accessibility requirements. The interconnected nature of these elements and the need for validation logic increases the complexity beyond basic UI development."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Create Attendance Listing View",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the listing view implementation into subtasks for data retrieval from IndexedDB, sorting functionality, UI rendering, and real-time updates",
      "reasoning": "This task involves retrieving and displaying data with specific sorting requirements. It's moderately complex due to the need for dynamic updates when data changes and ensuring proper integration with the database layer."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Record Deletion",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the deletion functionality into subtasks for UI elements, confirmation dialog, IndexedDB integration, and list view updates",
      "reasoning": "This is a focused feature with clear requirements. The complexity is moderate as it involves user interaction, confirmation dialogs, database operations, and UI updates, but each component is relatively straightforward."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Add Data Export Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the export functionality into subtasks for data retrieval, JSON conversion, file generation with timestamp, and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This is a self-contained feature with moderate complexity. It requires data retrieval, format conversion, and browser file download capabilities, but each component is well-defined and the scope is limited."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Simple Navigation",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the navigation implementation into subtasks for UI elements, view switching logic, state management, and accessibility features",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively simple task focused on creating navigation between two views without page reloads. The requirements are straightforward with minimal complexity, though proper state management and accessibility still need consideration."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize and Clean Up Code",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the code optimization into subtasks for HTML cleanup, CSS refactoring, JavaScript optimization, naming convention standardization, and dependency reduction",
      "reasoning": "This task requires a comprehensive review of all code with multiple objectives (removing unnecessary elements, consolidating duplicates, ensuring conventions). The complexity comes from the breadth of the task across all application components and the judgment required."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Final Testing and Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down testing and documentation into subtasks for cross-browser testing, responsive design verification, offline functionality testing, error scenario validation, code documentation, and README creation",
      "reasoning": "This task encompasses comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions (browsers, screen sizes, error scenarios, offline functionality) plus documentation. The breadth of testing required and the variety of scenarios to cover increases the complexity significantly."
