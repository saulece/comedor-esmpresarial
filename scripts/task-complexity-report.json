      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project structure setup into specific subtasks covering directory creation, base file setup, HTML structure implementation, and responsive design configuration",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with clear boundaries. It involves standard project setup activities that are well-defined and don't require complex logic or integrations."

      "taskTitle": "Implementar sistema de autenticación",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering UI form creation, credential validation logic, session management, role-based redirections, and logout functionality",
      "reasoning": "Authentication involves both UI and business logic components, with moderate complexity due to role-based access control and session management requirements using localStorage."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user management functionality into subtasks covering the creation form, data storage implementation, user listing view, form validations, and CRUD operations",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple CRUD operations with form validations and data persistence, but uses familiar localStorage patterns established in task 2."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implementar gestión de menús semanales",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the weekly menu management into subtasks covering menu input interface, date selection functionality, data storage implementation, publication status toggling, validation logic, and preview functionality",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the multi-day menu structure, date handling, and publication status management. It requires a more sophisticated data model and UI interactions."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the attendance confirmation system into subtasks covering weekly menu display, attendance input form with validations, data storage implementation, update functionality, and visual feedback components",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex validation rules (maximum attendees per coordinator) and depends on the menu system. It requires careful state management and user feedback."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implementar dashboard de reportes de asistencia",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the attendance reporting dashboard into subtasks covering data aggregation functions, total attendance display, coordinator breakdown views, visual indicators for attendance levels, and historical data filtering",
      "reasoning": "This task requires complex data aggregation and visualization. The calculations and filtering options add significant complexity, especially for historical data handling."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Optimizar interfaz de usuario y experiencia de usuario",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI/UX optimization into subtasks covering CSS styling system, reusable component creation, navigation improvements, user feedback mechanisms, responsive design implementation, and animation/transition effects",
      "reasoning": "This is a broad task that touches every part of the application. Creating a consistent design system with responsive behavior and animations requires significant effort and expertise."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implementar validaciones y manejo de errores",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the validation and error handling implementation into subtasks covering form validation system, error message creation, localStorage error handling, confirmation dialogs, and notification system",
      "reasoning": "This cross-cutting concern affects multiple components and requires careful implementation to ensure consistent behavior throughout the application. Error handling edge cases add complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Desarrollar funcionalidad de exportación de datos",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data export functionality into subtasks covering library research and selection, data transformation functions, export UI implementation, and Excel file formatting",
      "reasoning": "While this involves integrating a third-party library, the scope is limited to a specific feature with clear requirements. The complexity comes from data transformation and formatting."
    },
